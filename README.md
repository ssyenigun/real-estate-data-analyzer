# Real Estate Data Analyzer

A Python-based tool for analyzing and visualizing real estate data. This project aims to help users gain insights into real estate trends, prices, and other key metrics by processing and analyzing datasets.

## Features

- Import and process real estate datasets (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- Perform statistical analysis on property prices, locations, and trends
- Generate visualizations such as price distribution, location heatmaps, and trend graphs
- Filter and query data based on user-defined criteria
- Export processed data and analysis results

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ssyenigun/real-estate-data-analyzer.git
   cd real-estate-data-analyzer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your real estate dataset (e.g., `data.csv`) in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the main script to analyze the data:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to select analysis options or view visualizations.
